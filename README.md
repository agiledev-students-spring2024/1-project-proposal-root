## Internship Insight

### What and Why?
Internship insight is a platform designed to streamline the internship search and application process for college students. The problem this system aims to solve is the fragmented and inefficient process students face when searching for relevant internships. 

Lots of students struggle finding oppurtunities that align with their skills, interests and career goals. 

Internship insight addresses these challenges by providing an experience that simplifies the search -> application -> prepation phases of securing an internship. 

### For whom?
NYU students in the internship seeking process

### How (From end user perspective) ?
* Personalized dashboard: Upon signing up, students will create a profile detailing their major, skills, interests, and internship preferences.
* Internship Matching: The platform will then present students with a list of internships that match their profile.
* Application Tracker: Students can track the internships they're interested in, manage applications, and receive reminders for upcoming deadlines.
*  AI-Powered Personalized Email Drafts : Students can generate personalized cold emails to shoot their shot!

### Scope
I think this project is a balanced challenge for a semester long project. Initially we would focus on developing features like the personalized dashboard, internship matching (maybe not include this feature) , application tracker, cold email template.

These features can provide a good learning experience and still be achievable within the time frame.
